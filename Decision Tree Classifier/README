We use a real dataset to train each of these models.
The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
We will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not with Scikit-Learn Python interface,
and Snap Machine Learning (Snap ML) library.
