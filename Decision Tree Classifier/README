We use a real dataset to train Decision Tree Classifier model.
The dataset includes information about transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
We will use the trained model to assess if a credit card transaction is legitimate or not with Scikit-Learn, and Snap Machine Learning 
(Snap ML) library.
